  # Fix User Registration RLS Issue

  1. Problem Analysis
    - Users cannot insert their profile during registration due to RLS policy
    - The auth.uid() might not be immediately available during the registration flow
    - Need to ensure proper policy setup for user profile creation

  2. Solution
    - Create a SECURITY DEFINER function to handle user profile creation
    - Update RLS policies to work with the registration flow
    - Ensure proper permissions for authenticated users

  3. Security
    - Maintain security by ensuring users can only create their own profiles
    - Use SECURITY DEFINER function to bypass RLS when necessary
    - Keep all other security measures intact
